# News On Updates in F-Sy-H

**2018-08-09**

Added ideal string highlighting – FSH now handles any legal quoting and combination of `"`,`'` and `\` when highlighting
program arguments. See the introduction for an example (item #14).

**2018-08-02**

Global aliases are now supported:

Hint – how to customize styles when using Zplugin and turbo mode:

```zsh
zplugin ice wait"1" atload"set_fast_theme"
zplugin light zdharma/fast-syntax-highlighting

set_fast_theme() {
    FAST_HIGHLIGHT_STYLES[${FAST_THEME_NAME}paired-bracket]='bg=blue'
    FAST_HIGHLIGHT_STYLES[${FAST_THEME_NAME}bracket-level-1]='fg=red,bold'
    FAST_HIGHLIGHT_STYLES[${FAST_THEME_NAME}bracket-level-2]='fg=magenta,bold'
    FAST_HIGHLIGHT_STYLES[${FAST_THEME_NAME}bracket-level-3]='fg=cyan,bold'
}
```

If you have set theme before an update of styles (e.g. recent addition of bracket highlighting) then please repeat
`fast-theme {theme}` call to regenerate theme files. (**2018-08-09**: FSH now has full user-theme support, refer to
[appropriate section of README](#customization)).

**2018-07-30**

Ideal highlighting of brackets (pairing, etc.) – no quoting can disturb the result:

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zdharma/fast-syntax-highlighting/master/images/brackets.gif)

`FAST_HIGHLIGHT[use_brackets]=1` to enable this feature (**2018-07-31**: not needed anymore, this highlighting is active
by default).

**2018-07-21**

Chroma architecture now supports aliases. You can have `alias mygit="git commit"` and when `mygit` will be invoked
everything will work as expected (Git chroma will be ran).

**2018-07-11**

There were problems with Ctrl-C not working when using FSH. After many days I've found a fix for this, it's pushed to
master.

Second, asynchronous path checking (useful on e.g. slow network drives, or when there are many files in directory) is
now optional. Set `FAST_HIGHLIGHT[use_async]=1` to enable it. This saves some users from Zshell crashes – there's an
unknown bug in Zsh.

**2018-06-09**

New chroma functions: `awk`, `make`, `perl`, `vim`. Checkout the [video](https://asciinema.org/a/186234), it shows
functionality of `awk` – compiling of code and NOT running it. Perl can do this too:
[video](https://asciinema.org/a/186098).

**2018-06-06**

FSH gained a new architecture – "chroma functions". They are similar to "completion functions", i.e. they are defined
**per-command**, but instead of completing that command, they colorize it. Two chroma exist, for `Git`
([video](https://asciinema.org/a/185707), [video](https://asciinema.org/a/185811)) and for `grep`
([video](https://asciinema.org/a/185942)). Checkout
[example chroma](https://github.com/zdharma/fast-syntax-highlighting/blob/master/chroma/-example.ch) if you would like
to highlight a command.

Highlighting of command substitution (i.e. `$(...)`) with alternate theme – two themes at once! It was just white
before:

![sshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zdharma/fast-syntax-highlighting/master/images/cmdsubst.png)

To select which theme to use for `$(...)` set the key `secondary=` in
[theme ini file](https://github.com/zdharma/fast-syntax-highlighting/blob/master/themes/free.ini#L7). All shipped themes
have this key set (only the `default` theme doesn't use second theme).

Also added correct highlighting of descriptor-variables passed to `exec`:

**2018-05-30**

For-loop is highlighted, it has separate settings in
[theme file](https://github.com/zdharma/fast-syntax-highlighting/blob/master/themes/free.ini).

![sshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zdharma/fast-syntax-highlighting/master/images/for-loop.png)

**2018-05-27**

Added support for 256-color themes. There are six themes shipped with FSH. The command to switch theme is
`fast-theme {theme-name}`, it has a completion which lists available themes and options. Checkout
[asciinema recording](https://asciinema.org/a/183814) that presents the themes.

**2018-05-25**

Hash holding paths that shouldn't be grepped (globbed) – blacklist for slow disks, mounts, etc.:

```zsh
typeset -gA FAST_BLIST_PATTERNS
FAST_BLIST_PATTERNS[/mount/nfs1/*]=1
FAST_BLIST_PATTERNS[/mount/disk2/*]=1
```

**2018-05-23**

Assign colorizing now spans to variables defined by `typeset`, `export`, `local`, etc.:

![sshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zdharma/fast-syntax-highlighting/master/images/typeset.png)

Also, `zcalc` has a separate math mode and specialized highlighting – no more light-red colors because of treating
`zcalc` like a regular command-line:

![sshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zdharma/fast-syntax-highlighting/master/images/zcalc.png)

**2018-05-22**

Array assignments were still boring, so I throwed in bracked colorizing:

![sshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zdharma/fast-syntax-highlighting/master/images/array-assign.png)

**2018-05-22**<a name="assign-update"></a>

Assignments are no more one-colour default-white. When used in assignment, highlighted are:

- variables (outside strings),
- strings (double-quoted and single-quoted),
- math-mode (`val=$(( ... ))`).

![sshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zdharma/fast-syntax-highlighting/master/images/assign.png)

**2018-01-06**

Math mode is highlighted – expressions `(( ... ))` and `$(( ... ))`. Empty variables are colorized as red. There are 3
style names (fields of
[FAST_HIGHLIGHT_STYLES](https://github.com/zdharma/fast-syntax-highlighting/blob/master/fast-highlight#L34) hash) for
math-variable, number and empty variable (error): `mathvar`, `mathnum`, `matherr`. You can set them (like the animation
below shows) to change colors.
